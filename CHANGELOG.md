# Changelog

## 0.4.3

* Adds include-what-you-use option in CMake configuration.
* Use the supported mingwpy toolchain from pypi.anaconda.org/carlkl/simple
* Define BOOST_MATH_NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS for nupic.core source build in attempt to make build work with official mingwpy toolchain
* Protect all public member variables (except connections)
* Move algorithm details out of the compute method
* Split bamboo linux build into debug and release.
* Move common environment setup for Bamboo into separate script.
* Update SWIG to use local tarfile rather than download from sourceforge.
* Store the new lastUsedIteration, don't just increment old one
* Unit test: destroyed synapse + segment reuse
* Bugfix: Keep the destroyed synapses count in sync.
* Walk the columns and segments via ExcitedColumns iterator
* Fail loudly when Python regions reassign an output
* Disable asserts in release builds
* De-duplicate a loop.
* Removes 'long double', NTA_QUAD_PRECISION, and Real128 references from our code.
* Add Proto for SDR Classifier
* TemporalMemory: replace phases with "columnSegmentWalk". Much faster.
* MovingAverage.compute() returns updated value

## 0.4.2

* Define and use environment variables containing compiler and linker flags specifically for 3rd-party source code.
* Revert to installing mingwpy toolchains from https://bitbucket.org/carlkl/mingw-w64-for-python/downloads.
* Better rand() approach, won't ever be greater than 1
* Stop computing overlaps twice per timestep. 4% faster.
* Stop storing segment overlap counts in a map. Now 56% faster.
* Enable errors for windows32 build in the matrix.
* Use proper float comparisons to avoid issues on 32 vs 64 bit machines.
* Perf: When using sets, use std::set::find, not std::find
* Swig needs `-include cmath` when building with mingw toolchain.
* Initialize swig_generated_file_compile_flags directly from COMMON_CXX_FLAGS_OPTIMIZED to avoid -Werror.
* Comment out header and binary install targets in CapnProto.cmake, since this is a duplicate of the exact same steps in srce/CMakeLists.txt, which installs other externals as well.
* Attempt to fix execution of helloregion test from Travis build by modifying .travis.yml to change directory to build/release/bin just as instructed by nupic.core/README.md.
* Added a comment about nupic.core's swig wraps relying on the macro CAPNP_LITE to have a value.
* Fix windows build of nupic.core's Swig wraps that expects CAPNP_LITE not only to be defined (capnp recommends just defining it), but to actually have a value (non-zero).
* Invoke additional nupic.core tests in Travis to make sure that things get tested and tests don't get broken again unnoticed:   connections_performance_test   helloregion   hello_sp_tp   prototest
* Refactored CommonCompilerConfig.cmake to exposed optimized and unoptimized flag sets. Fixed linux GCC build of CapnProto components by changing its configuration to use unoptimized versions of common flags. Cleaned up use of local variables in src/CMakeFiles.txt. nupic.core/CmakeLists.txt is now the only place that defines REPOSITORY_DIR for use by other modules. Fixed dependency in add_custom_command function inside CREATE_CAPNPC_COMMAND to use passed-in arg SPEC_FILES instead of a property from src/CMakeLists.txt.
* Add BITNESS to Swig.cmake

## 0.4.1

* Cast arg to UInt32 to avoid call resolution ambiguity on the value.write() method on Win32 platform.
* Finish adding support for the Bool type
* Expose encoder's 'n' so other regions' inputWidth is calculable from the outside
* Remove reference to deleted Linear.cpp.
* Run nupic.core encoders via boilerplate Sensor wrapper
* Removes Linear.hpp, Linear.cpp, and reference in algorithms.i since it doesn't appear to be used anywhere.
* Support Debug builds in Clang, put them in README
* Add a NTA_BasicType_Bool so that we can parse bools in YAML
* FloatEncoder base, no more common Encoder, new signature
* Prepends BINDINGS_VERSION plus dot separater to wheel filename
* Fix integer division bug, add tests that would catch this bug
* Don't divide by a constant. Multiply. Dodges divide-by-0.
* Explicitly mark all derived virtual methods as virtual.
* Fix gcc build issue
* C++ Encoder base + ScalarEncoder + ported unit tests

## 0.4.0

* Reduce EPSILON threshold for TM to minitage compatibility issues.
* Updates AV yaml to push a commit-sha'd wheel to AWS
* Reduce permanence threshold by epsilon before comparing to avoid rounding edge cases
* Make threshold for destroying synapses larger to catch roundoff errors
* Make comparison identical to python
* Add accessors for TM columnForCell and cellsForColumn
* Temporal Memory: recordIteration should be false in second call to computeActivity
* Fix: Incompatibility in Connections.computeActivity with python
* Change TM init parameters to accept segment and synapse limit.

## 0.3.1

* Secondary sort on segment idx
* Sort segments before iterating for python compatibility
* Sort unpredictedActiveColumns before iterating for python compatibility

## 0.3.0

* Updated SWIG bindings for accessors
* Added TemporalMemory accessors
* Update bindings for C++ Connections to expose 'read' class method
* Destroy lowest permanence synapse when synapse limit is reached
* Fix for bug in Segment::freeNSynapses
* Added initialization code from Tester::init into PathTest::PathTest that is required for PathTest::copyInTemp to run successfully.
* Remove references to Tester from UnitTestMain.cpp
* Deleted Tester class and TesterTest files
* Update SWIG binding of Network to add read class method
* Refactor PyRegion subclasses to take specific proto object in read
* Update SWIG binding of TemporalPooler to add read class method
* Enable basic building with ninja (cmake -GNinja)
* Added include of Log.hpp in NodeSet.hpp
* Update SWIG bindings of SpatialPooler and CLAClassifier to add read class methods to C++ classes

* Add Dockerfile for building nupic.core from source
* Update of Windows bindings setup
* Add "python setup.py test" option (fixes #697)
* Adding a CMake ExternalProject to download capnp win32 compiler tools
