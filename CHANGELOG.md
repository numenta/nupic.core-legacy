# Changelog

## 0.6.3

* Change the Connections to stop doing automatic segment / synapse cleanup
* Revamp the TemporalMemory proto so that it captures all information
* For numpy, use a single PyArray_API symbol per binary rather than one per cpp file
* Use numpy 1.12.1
* Use pycapnp 0.5.12
* Use latest pytest 3.0.7, pytest-cov 2.5.0, pytest-xdist 1.16.0

## 0.6.2

* Updated Circle CI configuration and switch to that for OS X builds (instead of Travis CI)
* Documentation updates: PyRegion
* IWYU documentation update
* Fixed C++ boolean ref counting bug that caused segfaults when running Python projects

* Implemented byte buffer passing as alternative Python<->C++ strategy for capnp serialization logic. This has some memory/speed overhead but avoids ABI issues that could cause crashes
* Fixed prototest to get meaningful comparison numbers

## 0.6.1

* Eliminate installation of unnecessary header files when building nupic.bindings. Install Version.hpp unconditionally for the sake of the deployment usage in .travis.yaml
* Fixed servicing of delayed links such that the circular buffers of all links within a network are refreshed at the end of each time step; and 0-delay links copy data directly from src to dest, bypassing the circular buffer altogether.
* Add a nNonZerosPerRowOnCols SparseMatrix method
* Fix up some out of date SWIG interface code

## 0.6.0

* NUP-2366 Remove no-longer-relevent test code

* Regenerate SWIG bindings C++ files if any headers change.
* Enable -D_LIBCPP_DEBUG=0 for debug-lite in Clang builds (e.g., OS X). NOTE: Clan't debug mode is not mature, and anything above level 0 appears to require debug build of libc++ during linking, which it not present by default on OS X.

## 0.4.5

* Removed no longer used pre-built Swig executables for various flavors of Linux; nupic.core automatically builds Swig from embedded sources on non-Windows platforms.
* DEVOPS-141 Apply an export map to OS X, Linux, and MINGW builds of nupic.bindings shared objects.
* Refactor extension build steps into a function shared by algorithms, math, engine_internal, etc. in preparation for adding export maps.
* Work around issue in cmake 2.8.7: have external project AprUtil1StaticLib depend directly on external project Apr1StaticLib instead of its library wrapper ${APR1_STATIC_LIB_TARGET}; the latter was incorrectly interperting the dependency as another external project instead of library; but worked correctly on cmake 2.8.12.
* Completed wrapping of external static libs in `add_library` targets
* Represent external build of capnproto as single static library with target name ${CAPNP_STATIC_LIB_TARGET} and containing all capnproto library objects.
* No need for custom target in CREATE_CAPNPC_COMMAND function, since nupic_core_solo is the only consumer of the custom command's outputs.
* Try building nupic_core_solo intermediate static library without specifying system libraries. It's a static library and shouldn't need additional linking information.
* Removed nupic_core_solo from installed targets, since it's only an intermediate artifact and not intended to be an output product.
* issue-1034 Reorganized build to link nupic_core static library tests against the "combined" nupic_core static library, which is considered an output artifact, instead of nupic_core_solo static lib, which is only an intermediate step.
* Use library utils to correctly combine multiple static libraries into a single one.
* DEVOPS-135 Implement a hacky work-around by preloading pycapnp's exteions DLL in RTLD_GLOBAL mode, which enables resultion of capnproto references when nupic.bidnings extensions are loaded.
* Consider EPSILON while finding minPermanenceSynapse
* Refactor to make GCC stop finding false positives
* New implementation of GCC_UNINITIALIZED_VAR
* DEVOPS-135 Remove capnproto from python extensions shared libs in order to avoid conflict with capnproto methods compiled into pycapnp, possibly compiled with a different compiler/version and with different compiler/linker flags. Instead, we rely on dynamic linking of the necessary symbols from capnproto in pycapnp.
* Avoid clang error "unknown warning option '-Wno-maybe-uninitialized'"
* Store EPSILON as a static const Permanence
* Disable GCC's maybe-uninitialized warnings. Too many false positives.

* fixes floating point comparison bug
* Use group_by in TemporalMemory. No more ExcitedColumns.
* Work around another GCC maybe-uninitialized faulty error

* Added a comment about nupic.core's swig wraps relying on the macro CAPNP_LITE to have a value.

* Refactored CommonCompilerConfig.cmake to exposed optimized and unoptimized flag sets. Fixed linux GCC build of CapnProto components by changing its configuration to use unoptimized versions of common flags.
