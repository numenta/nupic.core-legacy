# Builds and tests the nupic.bindings python extension using Release build
# type.
#
# ASSUMPTIONS:
#          1. Building via Numenta Vagrant Task using Vagrant image
#             bamboo-vagrant-windows-1.x.x.
#
#          2. nupic.core root is the current directory on entry.
#
#          3. Expects a pristine nupic.core source tree without any remnant
#             build artifacts from prior build attempts. Otherwise, the
#             behavior is undefined.
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   nupic.bindings wheel: On success, the resulting wheel will be located in
#                         the subdirectory nupic_bindings_wheelhouse of the
#                         source tree's root directory.
#
#   Test results: nupic.bindings test results will be located in the
#                 subdirectory test_results of the source tree's root directory
#                 with the following content:
#
#                 junit-test-results.xml
#                 htmlcov/

# Stop and fail script if any command fails
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

# Trace script lines as they run
Set-PsDebug -Trace 1



$NupicCoreRootDir = $(get-location).Path



# Use this function to wrap external commands for powershell error-checking.
#
# This is necessary so that `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` will have the
# desired effect.
#
# Returns True if command's $LastExitCode was 0, False otherwise
#
# Usage: WrapCmd { cmd arg1 arg2 ... }
