USAGE="Usage:

[BUILD_TYPE=Release | Debug] [WHEEL_PLAT=platform] $( basename ${0} )

This script builds and tests the nupic.bindings Python extension.

In Debug builds, also
  - Turns on the Include What You Use check (assumes iwyu is installed)

ASUMPTION: Expects a pristine nupic.core source tree without any remnant build
   artifacts from prior build attempts. Otherwise, behavior is undefined.


INPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

  BUILD_TYPE : Specifies build type, which may be either Release or Debug;
               defaults to Release. [OPTIONAL]
  WHEEL_PLAT : Wheel platform name; pass manylinux1_x86_64 for manylinux build;
               leave undefined for all other builds.

OUTPUTS:
  nupic.bindings wheel: On success, the resulting wheel will be located in the
                        subdirectory nupic_bindings_wheelhouse of the source
                        tree's root directory.

  test results: nupic.bindings test results will be located in the subdirectory
                test_results of the source tree's root directory with the
                the following content:

                junit-test-results.xml
                htmlcov/
