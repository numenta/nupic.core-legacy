# NuPIC Core [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/numenta/nupic.core.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/numenta/nupic.core)

> This project is still in the process of being extracted from the [NuPIC](http://github.com/numenta/nupic) codebase as a part of our [core extraction plan](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/nupic.core-Extraction-Plan). 

**This README isn't done yet**

This repository contains the C++ source code for the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing ([NuPIC](http://numenta.org/nupic.html)). It will eventually contain all algorithms for NuPIC, but is currently in a transition period. For details on building NuPIC within the python environment, please see http://github.com/numenta/nupic.
