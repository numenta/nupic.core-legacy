`NuPIC Core` contains core algorithms for NuPIC (the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing), implemented in C++.

The source of this project is available at https://github.com/numenta/nupic , and is still in the process of being extracted from the [NuPIC](http://github.com/numenta/nupic) codebase as a part of NuPIC's [core extraction plan](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/nupic.core-Extraction-Plan). 

For more information, see [numenta.org](http://numenta.org) or the [NuPIC wiki](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki).
