       * CLA spatial pooler implementation in C++.
       *
       * ### Description
       * The Spatial Pooler is responsible for creating a sparse distributed
       * representation of the input. Given an input it computes a set of sparse
       * active columns and simultaneously updates its permanences, duty cycles,
       * etc.
       *
       * The primary public interfaces to this function are the "initialize"
       * and "compute" methods.
       *
       * Example usage:
       *
       *     SpatialPooler sp;
       *     sp.initialize(inputDimensions, columnDimensions, <parameters>);
       *     while (true) {
       *        <get input vector>
       *        sp.compute(inputVector, learn, activeColumns)
       *        <do something with output>
       *     }

          virtual ~SpatialPooler() {}

          /**
          Initialize the spatial pooler using the given parameters.

          @param inputDimensions A list of integers representing the
                dimensions of the input vector. Format is [height, width,
                depth, ...], where each value represents the size of the
                dimension. For a topology of one dimesion with 100 inputs
                use [100]. For a two dimensional topology of 10x5
                use [10,5].

          @param columnDimensions A list of integers representing the
                dimensions of the columns in the region. Format is [height,
                width, depth, ...], where each value represents the size of
                the dimension. For a topology of one dimesion with 2000
                columns use 2000, or [2000]. For a three dimensional
                topology of 32x64x16 use [32, 64, 16].

          @param potentialRadius This parameter deteremines the extent of the
                input that each column can potentially be connected to. This
                can be thought of as the input bits that are visible to each
                column, or a 'receptive field' of the field of vision. A large
                enough value will result in global coverage, meaning
                that each column can potentially be connected to every input
                bit. This parameter defines a square (or hyper square) area: a
                column will have a max square potential pool with sides of
                length (2 * potentialRadius + 1).

          @param potentialPct The percent of the inputs, within a column's
                potential radius, that a column can be connected to. If set to
                1, the column will be connected to every input within its
                potential radius. This parameter is used to give each column a
                unique potential pool when a large potentialRadius causes
                overlap between the columns. At initialization time we choose
                ((2*potentialRadius + 1)^(# inputDimensions) * potentialPct)
                input bits to comprise the column's potential pool.

          @param globalInhibition If true, then during inhibition phase the
                winning columns are selected as the most active columns from the
                region as a whole. Otherwise, the winning columns are selected
                with resepct to their local neighborhoods. Global inhibition
                boosts performance significantly but there is no topology at the
                output.

          @param localAreaDensity The desired density of active columns within
                a local inhibition area (the size of which is set by the
                internally calculated inhibitionRadius, which is in turn
                determined from the average size of the connected potential
                pools of all columns). The inhibition logic will insure that at
                most N columns remain ON within a local inhibition area, where
                N = localAreaDensity * (total number of columns in inhibition
                area). If localAreaDensity is set to a negative value output
                sparsity will be determined by the numActivePerInhArea.

          @param numActiveColumnsPerInhArea An alternate way to control the sparsity of
                active columns. If numActivePerInhArea is specified then
                localAreaDensity must be less than 0, and vice versa. When
                numActivePerInhArea > 0, the inhibition logic will insure that
                at most 'numActivePerInhArea' columns remain ON within a local
                inhibition area (the size of which is set by the internally
                calculated inhibitionRadius). When using this method, as columns
                learn and grow their effective receptive fields, the
                inhibitionRadius will grow, and hence the net density of the
                active columns will *decrease*. This is in contrast to the
                localAreaDensity method, which keeps the density of active
                columns the same regardless of the size of their receptive
                fields.

          @param stimulusThreshold This is a number specifying the minimum
                number of synapses that must be active in order for a column to
                turn ON. The purpose of this is to prevent noisy input from
                activating columns.

          @param synPermInactiveDec The amount by which the permanence of an
                inactive synapse is decremented in each learning step.

          @param synPermActiveInc The amount by which the permanence of an
                active synapse is incremented in each round.

          @param synPermConnected The default connected threshold. Any synapse
                whose permanence value is above the connected threshold is
                a "connected synapse", meaning it can contribute to
                the cell's firing.

          @param minPctOverlapDutyCycles A number between 0 and 1.0, used to set
                a floor on how often a column should have at least
                stimulusThreshold active inputs. Periodically, each column looks
                at the overlap duty cycle of all other column within its
                inhibition radius and sets its own internal minimal acceptable
                duty cycle to: minPctDutyCycleBeforeInh * max(other columns'
                duty cycles). On each iteration, any column whose overlap duty
                cycle falls below this computed value will get all of its
                permanence values boosted up by synPermActiveInc. Raising all
                permanences in response to a sub-par duty cycle before
                inhibition allows a cell to search for new inputs when either
                its previously learned inputs are no longer ever active, or when
                the vast majority of them have been "hijacked" by other columns.

          @param minPctActiveDutyCycles A number between 0 and 1.0, used to set
                a floor on how often a column should be activate. Periodically,
                each column looks at the activity duty cycle of all other
                columns within its inhibition radius and sets its own internal
                minimal acceptable duty cycle to:

                    minPctDutyCycleAfterInh * max(other columns' duty cycles).

                On each iteration, any column whose duty cycle after inhibition
                falls below this computed value will get its internal boost
                factor increased.

          @param dutyCyclePeriod The period used to calculate duty cycles.
                Higher values make it take longer to respond to changes in
                boost. Shorter values make it potentially more unstable and
                likely to oscillate.

          @param maxBoost The maximum overlap boost factor. Each column's
                overlap gets multiplied by a boost factor before it gets
                considered for inhibition. The actual boost factor for a column
                is a number between 1.0 and maxBoost. A boost factor of 1.0 is
                used if the duty cycle is >= minOverlapDutyCycle, maxBoost is
                used if the duty cycle is 0, and any duty cycle in between is
                linearly extrapolated from these 2 endpoints.

          @param seed Seed for our random number generator. If seed is < 0
                a randomly generated seed is used. The behavior of the spatial
                pooler is deterministic once the seed is set.

          @param spVerbosity spVerbosity level: 0, 1, 2, or 3

          @param wrapAround boolean value that determines whether or not inputs
                at the beginning and end of an input dimension are considered
                neighbors for the purpose of mapping inputs to columns.

          This is the main workshorse method of the SpatialPooler class. This

          columns. If 'learn' is set to True, this method also performs
          learning.

          @param inputVector An array of integer 0's and 1's that comprises
                the input to the spatial pooler. The length of the
                array must match the total number of input bits implied by
                the constructor (also returned by the method getNumInputs). In
                cases where the input is multi-dimensional, inputVector is a
                flattened array of inputs.

          @param learn A boolean value indicating whether learning should be
                performed. Learning entails updating the permanence values of
                the synapses, duty cycles, etc. Learning is typically on but
                setting learning to 'off' is useful for analyzing the current
                state of the SP. For example, you might want to feed in various
                inputs and examine the resulting SDR's. Note that if learning
                is off, boosting is turned off and columns that have never won

                          that are connected to input bits which are turned on.

              Update the boost factors for all columns. The boost factors are used to
              increase the overlap of inactive columns to improve their chances of
              becoming active. and hence encourage participation of more columns in the
              learning process. This is a line defined as: y = mx + b boost =
              (1-maxBoost)/minDuty * dutyCycle + maxFiringBoost. Intuitively this means
              that columns that have been active enough have a boost factor of 1, meaning
              their overlap is not boosted. Columns whose active duty cycle drops too much
              below that of their neighbors are boosted depending on how infrequently they
              have been active. The more infrequent, the more they are boosted. The exact
              boost factor is linearly interpolated between the points (dutyCycle:0,
              boost:maxFiringBoost) and (dutyCycle:minDuty, boost:1.0).
