/**
Note: this is an implementation from python in nupic repository.

This module analyzes and estimates the distribution of averaged anomaly scores
from a given model. Given a new anomaly score `s`, estimates `P(score >= s)`.

The number `P(score >= s)` represents the likelihood of the current state of
predictability. For example, a likelihood of 0.01 or 1% means we see this much
predictability about one out of every 100 records. The number is not as unusual
as it seems. For records that arrive every minute, this means once every hour
and 40 minutes. A likelihood of 0.0001 or 0.01% means we see it once out of
10,000 records, or about once every 7 days.

USAGE
-----

There are 3 ways to use the code: 
- using the convenience Anomaly class with `mode=LIKELIHOOD` (method `compute()`),
- using the AnomalyLikelihood helper class (method `anomalyProbability()`), or
- using the raw individual functions.

      NOTE: Anomaly likelihood scores are reported at a flat 0.5 for
    learningPeriod + estimationSamples iterations.

    claLearningPeriod and learningPeriod are specifying the same variable,
    although claLearningPeriod is a deprecated name for it.

    @param learningPeriod (claLearningPeriod: deprecated) - (int) the number of
      iterations required for the algorithm to learn the basic patterns in the
      dataset and for the anomaly score to 'settle down'. The default is based
      on empirical observations but in reality this could be larger for more
      complex domains. The downside if this is too large is that real anomalies
      might get ignored and not flagged.

    @param estimationSamples - (int) the number of reasonable anomaly scores
      required for the initial estimate of the Gaussian. The default of 100
      records is reasonable - we just need sufficient samples to get a decent
      estimate for the Gaussian. It's unlikely you will need to tune this since
      the Gaussian is re-estimated every 10 iterations by default.

    @param historicWindowSize - (int) size of sliding window of historical
      data points to maintain for periodic reestimation of the Gaussian. Note:
      the default of 8640 is based on a month's worth of history at 5-minute
      intervals.

    @param reestimationPeriod - (int) how often we re-estimate the Gaussian
      distribution. The ideal is to re-estimate every iteration but this is a
      performance hit. In general the system is not very sensitive to this
      number as long as it is small relative to the total number of records
      processed.
