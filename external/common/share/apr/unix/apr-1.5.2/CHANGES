Changes for APR 1.5.2

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2015-1829 (cve.mitre.org)
     APR applications using APR named pipe support on Windows can be 
     vulnerable to a pipe squatting attack from a local process; the extent
     of the vulnerability, when present, depends on the application.
     Initial analysis and report was provided by John Hernandez of Casaba 
     Security via HP SSRT Security Alert.  [Yann Ylavic]

     per process.  PR 57677.  [Jeff Trawick]

     apr_escape_path and set the correct return value in case we actually
     escape the string. [<aduryagin gmail.com>] PR 57230.

     "EDC8102I Operation would block" under load.
     [Pat Odonnell <patod us.ibm.com>]

  *) On z/OS, apr_sockaddr_info_get() with family == APR_UNSPEC was not

     [Rainer Jung]

Changes for APR 1.5.1

  *) apr_os_proc_mutex_get() on Unix:  Avoid segfault for cross-
     process pthread mutexes.  [Yann Ylavic <ylavic.dev gmail.com>]

  *) When using shmget-based shared memory, the ID used for ftok is
     now an APR hash of the filename instead of the constant '1'.
     We do this to help avoid collisions. PR 53996 [Jim Jagielski]

  *) apr_socket_atreadeof(): Fix breakage on OS X. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix POSIX shared memory (shm_open) use for named shared memory.
     Includes adding '--enable-posix-shm' to force POSIX shm if

     [Jozef Hatala <jh-asf skrt org>, Jim Jagielski]

     [Rainer Jung]

  *) Fix Linux kernel version check to recognize more versions,
     including versions 3.10 and later.  PR 55690.  [Joe Orton,
     Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis <arfrever.fta gmail.com>]

  *) Add apr_sockaddr_is_wildcard() to check if a socket address
     refers to the wildcard address for the protocol family (e.g.,
     0.0.0.0/INADDR_ANY for IPv4).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) apr_file_dup2() on Windows: Fix debug RTL assertion when 
     attempting to _commit(stdout) or _commit(stderr).  [Mike Rumph

     <ivan visualsvn.com>]

     namespace if the caller is unprivileged, fixing an inability of
     unprivileged callers to use apr_shm_create() with named shared
     memory segments under recent Windows.  As before, shared memory
     segments are created under the "Global" namespace for privileged
     callers.  Add apr_shm_create_ex() and apr_shm_attach_ex(), which
     provide the ability to override the normal namespace selection.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Update compile settings for MINT OS.  PR 47181. [Alan Hourihane
     <alanh fairlite.co.uk>]

  *) Add experimental cmake-based build system for Windows.  Refer to 
     README.cmake for more information.  [Jeff Trawick, Tom Donovan]

  *) Add the apr_table_getm() call, which transparently handles the
     merging of keys with multiple values. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add apr_hash_this_key(), apr_hash_this_key_len(), and 
     apr_hash_this_val() for easier access to those attributes from
     a hash iterator.  [Hyrum K. Wright <hyrum_wright mail.utexas.edu>]

  *) MinGW/MSYS:  Support shared builds of APR, other general improvements
     to support of this toolchain.  PR 46175.  [Carlo Bramini
